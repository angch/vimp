We're running this in antigravity, planning, gemini 3 pro (high)

The initial PRD is:

```
Load the prd skill and create a PRD for checking out https://github.com/GNOME/gimp in a "ref" directory that is not commited to git. Then analyze the code base for how the code works, what it is, in a way we can port the features over. All learnings are stored on the directory "doc" in a Markdown file.
```
