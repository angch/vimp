## Codebase Patterns
- GIMP Core Objects: `GimpItem` inherits from `GimpFilter`, indicating a graph-node based architecture.

- Verified `ref/gimp` exists and is a git repo
- Verified `ref/` is ignored in `.gitignore`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `ref/gimp` is already populated, likely from previous runs or manual setup.
  - `ref/` was already in `.gitignore`.

- Created `doc/gimp-analysis.md` with directory structure and build system analysis.
- Files changed:
  - `doc/gimp-analysis.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GIMP's core logic is deep in `app/`, splitting models (`core/`) from UI (`gui/`, `dialogs/`).
  - Build system is Meson; `meson.build` files are the source of truth for dependencies.

## 2026-01-28T20:03+08:00 - US-003
- Documented core data structures (Image, Layer, Item, Drawable) in `doc/gimp-analysis.md`.
- Created `doc/AGENTS.md` with GIMP-specific analysis instructions.
- Files changed:
  - `doc/gimp-analysis.md`
  - `doc/AGENTS.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `GimpItem` inherits from `GimpFilter`, which is unexpected but crucial.
  - Core logic is in `app/core/`.
  - Headers `gimpimage.h` and `gimplayer.h` are the source of truth for struct definitions.
