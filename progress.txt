- Validated `doc/gnome-hig-analysis.md` relative links against `ref/gnome-hig`
- Added Accessibility section to analysis
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `read_url_content` tool may struggle with local file paths (`file://`); verify file existence with `list_dir` or `view_file` instead.
  - HIG documentation structure is consistent, `../ref/gnome-hig/hig` works well as relative base.
