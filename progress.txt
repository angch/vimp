## Codebase Patterns
- Build prerequisites can be installed via `make install-deps` (Ubuntu 24.04).
- Document architecture decisions in `doc/architecture-analysis/`.
## Wed Jan 28 23:20:41 +08 2026 - US-001
- Implemented C++ GTK4 Hello World in `prototypes/cpp-gtk4`
- Created main Makefile for dependency installation (Ubuntu 24.04)
- Created `doc/architecture-analysis/gimp_gtk3_review.md` analyzing GIMP's current state
- Created `doc/architecture-analysis/cpp_gtk4_evaluation.md` documenting Pros/Cons and Packaging
- Verified Packaging with Flatpak manifest structure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Standard Ubuntu 24.04 repos require `libgtkmm-4.0-dev` which might need universe enabled or specific setup.
  - GIMP's move to GTK4 is delayed, suggesting a rewrite strategy is better than a direct port if we want GTK4 now.
  - C++ compile times and boilerplate are high even for hello world.

## Wed Jan 28 23:24:55 +08 2026 - US-001 (Fix)
- Addressed build failure in C++ GTK4 prototype
- Added missing `#include <iostream>` to main.cpp
- Added `build` target to prototypes/cpp-gtk4/Makefile
- Verified build succeeds

## Wed Jan 28 23:40:00 +08 2026 - US-002
- Researched GTK4 bindings for Zig, Rust, Go, and Dart.
- Created `doc/architecture-analysis/alternative_languages_review.md` with findings.
- Selected Rust (Safe/Mature) and Zig (Interop/risk) as top 2 candidates.
- Disqualified Go (GC/Cgo issues) and Dart (Flutter != Native GTK).
- Updated `doc/AGENTS.md` with Architecture Analysis section.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rust's `gtk-rs` is the only truly mature "safe" binding.
  - Zig has no mature high-level bindings but its "use C directly" feature is a unique strategic advantage for porting GIMP.
  - Dart is purely Flutter-focused on Desktop; no real "native GTK" ecosystem exists.

## Thu Jan 29 00:00:30 +08 2026 - US-003
- Implemented Rust GTK4 Canvas Prototype in `prototypes/rust-gtk4`
- Created `src/main.rs` with `DrawingArea` and custom drawing function
- Confirmed build succeeds
- Measured compile times: Cold ~38s, Warm ~0.5s
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `gtk4-rs` build times are significant for cold builds but very fast for incremental.
  - Rust development experience is smooth with `cargo`.
  - No extra system dependencies were needed beyond what `US-001` installed (gtk4).
