- Verified `ref/gimp` exists and is a git repo
- Verified `ref/` is ignored in `.gitignore`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `ref/gimp` is already populated, likely from previous runs or manual setup.
  - `ref/` was already in `.gitignore`.

- Created `doc/gimp-analysis.md` with directory structure and build system analysis.

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GIMP's core logic is deep in `app/`, splitting models (`core/`) from UI (`gui/`, `dialogs/`).
  - Build system is Meson; `meson.build` files are the source of truth for dependencies.
