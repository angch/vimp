## Codebase Patterns
- Build prerequisites can be installed via `make install-deps` (Ubuntu 24.04).
## Wed Jan 28 23:20:41 +08 2026 - US-001
- Implemented C++ GTK4 Hello World in `prototypes/cpp-gtk4`
- Created main Makefile for dependency installation (Ubuntu 24.04)
- Created `doc/architecture-analysis/gimp_gtk3_review.md` analyzing GIMP's current state
- Created `doc/architecture-analysis/cpp_gtk4_evaluation.md` documenting Pros/Cons and Packaging
- Verified Packaging with Flatpak manifest structure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Standard Ubuntu 24.04 repos require `libgtkmm-4.0-dev` which might need universe enabled or specific setup.
  - GIMP's move to GTK4 is delayed, suggesting a rewrite strategy is better than a direct port if we want GTK4 now.
  - C++ compile times and boilerplate are high even for hello world.

## Wed Jan 28 23:24:55 +08 2026 - US-001 (Fix)
- Addressed build failure in C++ GTK4 prototype
- Added missing `#include <iostream>` to main.cpp
- Added `build` target to prototypes/cpp-gtk4/Makefile
- Verified build succeeds
